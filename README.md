- 👋 Hi, I’m @dammit-casey
- 👀 I’m interested in learning some basic applications for HTML, JavaScript, Python, and some other progrmaming languages. 
     I am also hoping to collaborate on some fun applications, games, and other frivolous things using GitHub to try and get a better handle on using GitHub itself. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of JavaScript and the how to navigate the syntax of programming languages in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with some friends on some basic level porfolio projects, mainly from freecodecamp.org or exercism.com. 
- 📫 How to reach me...
